# Millitome Generator Suite V12

## strategies

can we do more scripting from external?

what can be done with FreeCAD Openscad plugin?

all virtual and physical 3d assets can be created in Openscad, using MT-Customizer; this works well for single or very low count MT creation. How can we do CSV creation? Parameters of a MT to be created accessible from Openscad code? From exported .json?
