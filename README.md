# Millitome Banana
 OpenScad code for Millitome building
 
 "Millitome V9kidney" was programmed in OpenScad 2021.1 on MacOS
 
 OpenScad is open source software https://openscad.org
 
 Files in the folder "stl files" were output by the OpenScad program.
 Files of the format c4d are for Cinema 4D, which was used to assemble & texture the STL components for web use.
 
 Contents stl subfolders.
 Subfolders are named by their block size in mm and "large","med","small", referring to the size of the kidney model. This creates a total of nine sets of millitome stl files. The blocks here are cubes (x=y) and were produced with the type=1 setting in the OpenScad code.
 
 10mm block array lg.stl    //block array for import into online interface
 10mm block ids lg.stl      //IDs matching each block
 10mm edits large.c4d       //Cinema 4D was used to assemble and texture individual components
 10mm insert labels lg.stl  //labels for row/column location
 10mm insert lg.stl         //the actual millitome geometry minus labels
 
 10mm_mt_large.stl          //millitome with all labels, this is the payload delivered to the 3d printer
